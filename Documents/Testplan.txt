Scenarios for Test Appication : 
1) When Arrival and Departure Stations are same , tickets cant be bought. returning fair as -1
2) Fare should be same on the same date when Arrival and Departure Station are just Swapped 
3) Fare should be same on the different date when Arrival and Departure Station are just Swapped 
4) Booking from same class type should be allowed on same date from same station 
5) only the class type are same every other thing is different so the fair should not be same 
6) Identical Booking on the same date should be allowed 
7) Different Booking on the same date should be allowed


SecondSitting : 
    I did a checking for the getters GetName(), IsAC(), IsSitting(), GetNumberOfTiers() and all of them were working correct
    I called the SetLoadFactor() and SetIsLuxury() of the class and checked both of them by again calling the corresponding get function and both of them were working correct.
    I setted the sIsLuxury and sLoadFactor to there original values so that there will be no error in fare calculation.

 Date : 
    copy assignment operator should work properly
    copy constructor operator should work properly
    I created a date object d1(05,07,2001) with normal constructor and it was getting created
    I created a date object d2 with copy assignment operator and it was getting created
    I created a date object d3 with copy constructor operator and it was getting created
    I double checked d2 and d3 by comparing their ToString() values
    I created another object d4 as (29,02,2020) which comes once in 4 years.
    I checked its Day() and it was correct
    I checked its ToString() and it was also correct.

Booking : 
    I made a sample booking and everything was correct.

Railways :
    The distance between any two station of the indian railways should be properly set
    On calling the fucntion for distance between any two station of the railways it should return correctly
    If data is not found distance return is -1
    I checked the GetName() of station "Ranchi" and it was giving bad node as expected.
    I also checked the GetDistance() of station "Mumbai" with "Ranchi" and it was giving -1 as expected.

Station :
    I created a station s1(Mumbai)
    I checked the copy constructor and copy assignment operator, by making s2 and s3
    I checked the GetName() of the station s1
    I checked the GetDistance() of the station s1
    I checked the GetName() with objects created with copy constructor ans copy assignment operator
